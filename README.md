## ðŸ”¬ 1. Tumor Classification Using Traditional ML

**Dataset**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))  
**Goal**: Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on diagnostic features.

### ðŸ”¹ Highlights:
- Built a full ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.
- Implemented and compared 7 different algorithms: SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluated models on accuracy, efficiency, and complexity.
- Achieved **96.1% accuracy**, with detailed comparison across algorithms.
- Focused on model generalization, optimization, and interpretability.

**Tools & Libraries**:  
`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Google Colab`

## ðŸ§® 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

**Dataset**: [MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  
**Goal**: Classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a Convolutional Neural Network.

### ðŸ”¹ Highlights:
- Designed a CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.
- Achieved **98.7% validation accuracy**, with strong generalization on unseen data.
- Applied preprocessing (normalization), used ReLU activations and softmax for output.
- Visualized training performance via loss/accuracy plots and feature map activations.

**Tools & Libraries**:  
`Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`
